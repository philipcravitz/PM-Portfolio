Ever peered into the mirror and thought, Who’s that? For product people, that stranger isn’t a crisis, it’s a gift. The universe is handing you a new perspective, the kind you can’t get from dashboards, decks, or yet another “quick sync.” Welcome to the funhouse.

We all crave the familiar. We seek the company of like-minded people. We hire people who remind us of ourselves. We build products we’d love to use. Familiarity bias keeps things comfortable while quietly narrowing our vision. But if we want to grow, as builders and as humans, we have to trade the pristine bathroom mirror for the funhouse version, the one that bends our perspective and forces us to imagine otherness.

It starts with honest self-reflection. Not the “do I have spinach in my teeth?” kind. The deeper kind where you admit what you prefer, what you assume, and how those preferences sneak into your product decisions. When you know your own defaults, you can spot when they’re quietly steering the ship.

The magic happens when you step outside yourself. Picture a real user, not the persona template, but someone whose day doesn’t orbit your product. I once watched a user breeze through a mortgage lead form flow until she hit a field labeled Location. She frowned. “Location… like where I am now, or where I want to be when I move?” That tiny confusion wasn’t visible in our analytics, but in that moment the distortion kicked in. Our internal jargon warped into clarity: she needed simpler language. Two words changed, and form abandonment dropped meaningfully. One small funhouse reflection, real impact.

Now that you’re thinking about the unfamiliar, you have to pull yourself back into the value-add of product management. It’s time to layer in the realities of the job: feasibility, security, cost, privacy, time-to-market, brand impact. The grown-up stuff. You orchestrate competing needs into something buildable. But if the funhouse version of the user doesn’t ultimately win, the product won’t either.

Then comes the proof. Testing, iterating, and refining based on real behavior, not what we hope to see. Experiments are little mirrors too. They tell us when our ideas shine and when they wobble. The trick is resisting the urge to design the test that flatters your reflection. Even hypotheses need funhouse scrutiny.

The journey from a self-focused mirror to a user-centered funhouse mirror is where creativity actually begins. The distortion is the point. It forces empathy. It reveals blind spots. It loosens the grip of our defaults.

So next time you look in the mirror, don’t ask for accuracy. Ask for distortion. Let the unfamiliar face staring back at you pull you out of your comfort zone and into the mind of your user, where innovation actually lives.
