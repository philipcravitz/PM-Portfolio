“What if?”
Two small words that change everything — and also the start of most meetings that go 30 minutes over schedule.

“What if” is the mindset that moves teams from constraint to creativity, from friction to flow. It’s how we expand the possible — how we imagine that the obstacle in front of us might have a solution if we stay curious long enough to find it.

In improv theater, there’s a principle called “Yes, and” — a way of co-creating by accepting what’s offered and building upon it. Product leadership is basically the same thing, except with fewer 2-drink minimums and more stakeholder meetings.

In product work, “What if” serves a similar purpose. It’s not about rejecting constraints, but reimagining them.

“What if compliance didn’t block us — what would need to change?”
“What if we tested a smaller version first?”
“What if both ideas were right, just for different users?”

I saw this play out on a project where we were debating how a lead form should be designed — short and simple, or multi-step and comprehensive.

Rather than take sides, I asked: “What if both could work?”

We prototyped each version, tested them with a user panel, and found both had strengths depending on the marketing strategy. Turns out, sometimes the right answer really is “both” — though try telling that to your sprint timeline.

That’s the power of “What if.” It’s optimism with discipline. Vision paired with validation.

As product leaders, our job isn’t just to solve problems — it’s to keep the door open long enough for better answers to walk through.

So the next time a challenge feels immovable, pause and ask, “What if we could?”

Worst case, you’ve sparked a new idea. Best case, you’ve just saved another meeting from turning into a sequel of No, But: The Blocker Chronicles.
