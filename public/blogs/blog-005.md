A recurring theme in my adventures of job hunting is the feeling that nobody sees me. I’m just a face in a crowd, a voice in a sea of other voices, and we’re all screaming to be noticed. I feel you. I would throw you a lifeline if I could, but I’m flailing for one myself.

So what do you do when your story is genuinely interesting, but no one seems to hear it? You could yell louder, throw your voice far and wide—apply to every job that even remotely fits your skills. Or, maybe you reach out to your network, the people who can amplify your story and help it spread to environs beyond normal reach. (That’s you, by the way. And by reading this, you’ve already given me a little boost. Thank you.)

So let’s talk about finding my voice before I lose it entirely from overuse. When I write my story, I have a few goals: I want to be authentic, I want to convey my experience, and I want to move you, dear reader, to some kind of action—even if that action is just a smile or a nod of recognition. So let's break it down:

What is my authentic self? I’m a curious problem solver, motivated by puzzles and reaching people’s cores, making their lives a little better. I bring humor to my work and deliver experiences that are empathetic and practical. My resume is full of facts that back that up, but here’s the thing—I like my voice, and I like that it hasn’t been lost in the process.

I want to reach you the way Professor Snape described potion-making in Harry Potter: “an Exact Art and Subtle Science.” Marketing is like that, but so is storytelling, or even a simple conversation. You aim for something deep, something core, and then hope what's offered resonates enough that someone takes a small leap of faith—presses a button, sends an email, picks up the phone… calls me. (Seriously. Call me. I’m ready to talk about jobs.)

It’s one thing to say, “I solve problems.” It’s another to show it. Like the time I helped a team untangle a project so complicated it made a Gordian knot look simple. By clarifying roles, mapping dependencies, and simplifying the workflow, we turned confusion into progress—and a few relieved smiles along the way.

Or the way I sprinkle humor into presentations and reports, not because I have to, but because people remember things when they laugh a little along the way. A witty one-liner in the middle of a dry slide deck can open the door to engagement in ways numbers alone never do.

In the end, I don’t want to lose my voice. I like how it sounds when I read it back. I like that I can bring experience, EQ, and practical know-how into something simultaneously silly and serious. Sharing it with you makes me happy, even in this sea of noise called unemployment.

And yes, I’m still looking for work. So if you can like, share, comment—or even just chuckle a little—you help me float a little higher. Maybe yours is the lifeline that gets me onto the right ship.
