Ever bite your tongue at work to seem “serious”?
Turns out, humor is how the best ideas show up.

I’ve always believed that humor is underappreciated in the workplace — not the kind that fills Slack boards or earns cheap laughs in meetings, but the subtle, human moments that make people sit up and pay attention. A well-timed anecdote, a self-deprecating line, or a playful question can break tension, build trust, and create space for real engagement. Humor, when used thoughtfully, becomes a tool for connection and productivity.

I learned this firsthand at a conference with 250+ senior executives, managers, and sales leaders. By the time I presented, my session was just one in a long line of talks that had stretched over several days. The room was tired, restless, and skeptical. During mic check, I knew I had to capture their attention immediately. So I asked off-stage, “Can everybody hear me?” Then, as I walked in, “Can everybody see me?” And finally, with a grin, I closed with: “Does anybody care?”

It was self-deprecating, unexpected, and perfectly timed. The room laughed, the tension broke, and I had their attention. For the next 60 minutes, I was able to hold the audience fully engaged with my content, discussions, and insights. A little humor had turned a potentially disengaged crowd into an invested one.

Another time, during a long offsite, I noticed the energy in the room was waning. Instead of plowing through the agenda, I paused and asked a playful question: “If the Vatican handed out Halloween candy, what would they give to kids?” The room erupted with ideas. Best answers included Bit-o-Holy, Three Pontifexes, and Sacromints. Everyone laughed, everyone participated, and suddenly the atmosphere was lighter, more collaborative. A simple, shared joke had recharged the room.

Humor isn’t a distraction — it’s an accelerant. It helps teams take risks, surface insights, and stay resilient when things go sideways. Even in job hunting, I’ve found that a well-timed anecdote or playful story can make you memorable in a sea of serious faces.

So here’s the takeaway: don’t underestimate the power of a chuckle. Infuse your work, your communications, and even your job search with small, human touches. They might just be the secret ingredient that boosts engagement, strengthens connections, and makes the day a lot more enjoyable for everyone — including you.

So what’s a moment when humor helped you connect, reset the room, or turn things around at work? Share with the group, you might just make our day.
