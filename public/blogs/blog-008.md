You’re a chicken. Really—just go with me. You want to cross the road. Step off the curb, shuffle to the other side. Stats say it’s a terrible idea: dangerous, low payoff, high risk. Yet you do it anyway because you have a notion. Life—and business—isn’t lived by numbers alone.

**Why Numbers Aren’t Enough**
I’ve watched a lot of chickens… and humans, by a stretch of imagination. Numbers are powerful, but they can’t tell the whole story. They need a human touch: someone curious, observant, and brave enough to ask, Why is this happening? What does it really mean?

Early in my career, I could crunch spreadsheets, spot trends, calculate ROI—basically a calculator on steroids. But numbers alone never answered the real questions. They could point to a problem—but not why people clicked, or didn’t.

**From Data to Action**
Case in point: At Wells Fargo, I presented routine reporting data. At first glance, the numbers looked… meh. But digging deeper, I noticed subtle patterns: some content categories were trending up, even though they were small compared to our main strategic areas. The insight? These emerging areas were bubbling with opportunity but underserved.

Instead of letting the data speak for itself (it’s notoriously bad at small talk), I added commentary: explaining what the numbers meant, why they mattered, and which work should be prioritized. A few well-placed “why” questions later, and the team pivoted toward high-value tasks. Suddenly, our reporting wasn’t just numbers—it was a playbook for smarter work. The payoff? Better resource allocation, emerging opportunities thriving, and a team aligned on what truly mattered.

**Lessons from the Chicken**
Finance skills—pattern recognition, risk assessment, rigorous analysis—translate perfectly across industries. They help you read people, interpret trends, and craft decisions that aren’t just technically correct, but truly meaningful.

Curiosity turns raw data into insight, insight into stories, and stories into action. AI can guess patterns—but it can’t understand humans the way a curious, observant person can. Human insight transforms complexity into clarity, dashboards into decisions, and raw data into opportunity.

**Take the Leap**
So yes, crossing the street is risky. But with curiosity, judgment, and a bit of chicken boldness, the payoff is huge: insight, confidence, and understanding. In work, as in life, that’s where human ingenuity—and a sense of humor—makes all the difference.
