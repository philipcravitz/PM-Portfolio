It has been over a year now of looking for a new job. I have learned a lot in that time, about the latest job market quirks, techniques and challenges. And I have to say, in summary, it's hard. I know, that is shockingly obvious, and in fairness, reductive, but what else can I say?

I have customized my resume, researched my target companies, leaned (lightly) on my network and have never been afraid to seriously consider any opportunity. And yet, I have applied to over 2,000 positions, gotten a handful of interviews and not been given any job offers... yet. 

I say yet because I know my heart, I am an optimist. And despite the empirical evidence to the contrary, I know this is going to happen, my finding a new job that will excite me, stimulate me, and allow me to bring my hope of making a meaningful difference to the world, in some way or fashion.

My roles in real estate and lending have been that for me. I've touched millions of lives, some very intimately, and helped them in their journey to achieve home ownership. It has been a source of pride for me to be doing something meaningful, and frankly, I don't think I could work for anything less.

All that said, and thank you if you've read this far, I intend to share my experience, musings, insights and lessons in a series of posts over the next part of my job-hunting journey. My goals:
1. Attract more attention to my profile - it's the reason I'm on LinkedIn
2. Provide a laugh or a thoughtful ponderance to anyone willing to put up with my nonsense
3. Give me a record of my journey and allow me to look back and see the progress I've made as a person and a job hunter

If all goes well, these will be the start of something great. Enjoy.
