AI ate my homework. That’s my story, and I’m sticking to it.

I’m no expert in job hunting, but after thousands of applications and countless hours refining my approach, I could probably give a TED Talk. Or at least book Carnegie Hall — because, as they say, practice for 10,000 hours and you’ll get there. Well, Mr. Carnegie, I’m ready for my debut.

To scale my job hunt while keeping it real, I built two tools:

The Super Resume — A living, breathing vault of every bullet point, metric, keyword, and accomplishment from my career.
The Customization App — A web-based applet that takes a job description + my super resume + a set of strict rules and outputs a targeted, ATS-optimized resume.

Think of it as my “truth factory.” No fabrications, just facts from my own career, carefully packaged for each job. I still proof it by hand to sound like me.

Does it work? Honestly, I don’t know. Articles say 60% of recruiters believe they can spot AI-generated resumes — and many don’t like them. Meanwhile, every application I submit is first screened by… an AI bot.
So here’s the paradox: To beat AI, I have to use AI. But recruiters seem to hate AI. It’s a loop only Kafka could love.

My happy balance? Using AI as an assistant, not a replacement. It helps me parse what’s important in a job posting, but the human voice is mine. Because at the end of the day, if someone hires me, it’s me who shows up — not my algorithmic sidekick.

It’s a dance: artificial and real, customized and scaled, efficiency and authenticity. And like any good tango, it takes two. So if you’re hiring and ready for a partner, I’m here — bringing both my human brain and my AI buddy to the floor.
