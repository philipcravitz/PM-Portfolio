Leadership’s winning bet: buy-in, not compliance.
Here’s how to get teams engaged, motivated, and even laughing, without a title or authority.

Early in my career, a mentor taught me a lesson I still carry today: when you hit a moment of disagreement, don’t push harder. Step back, piece by piece, until you find where you do agree, your common ground. This isn’t just about finding alignment; it’s also about spotting the places where you don’t. Once you know both, you can rebuild the conversation collaboratively, fill in gaps in understanding, adjust your approach to accommodate different perspectives, or occasionally charm people into seeing your point of view. Taken step by step, what could have been a clash turns into a collaborative dance (with fewer toes stepped on).

Leading teams without formal authority is built on that principle. You can’t lean on a title or an org chart, so you focus on connection, clarity, and shared purpose, plus the occasional well-timed smile. One technique I’ve found particularly effective is helping people see the big picture.

When I’m working with cross-functional teams, I don’t just assign tasks. I make sure everyone understands what we’re trying to accomplish and why it matters. I highlight the gaps, the pain points, and the problems we’re solving together. And then, I try to make it a little fun. People get agency in the process, their ideas shape outcomes, and suddenly we’re not just “working.” We’re inventing, improving, and sometimes laughing along the way.

Motivation without authority is also about creating momentum through shared wins. Celebrate progress, even the tiny victories. Reinforce how each person’s effort contributes to the mission. People may not report to you, but they will follow your lead if they understand the impact, feel heard, and have room to contribute creatively (and maybe even throw in a fun idea or two).

In short, leading without authority is about listening first, finding common ground, inspiring purpose, and empowering action, all while keeping your sense of humor intact. It’s not easy, but it’s one of the most rewarding ways to build collaboration, trust, and meaningful results in complex organizations. And if you can sneak in a laugh along the way, even better.
