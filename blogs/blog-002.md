Some questions make you stop in your tracks. Last week, someone asked me, “So what do you do for fun?”—and I realized I didn’t know the answer.

In years past, I would have had a ready list, ranked by pure happiness: hanging out with friends, seeing movies, reading a good book, going to Disneyland, cooking new recipes, writing creatively, and even occasionally working on a project I loved. But this time… nothing came to mind. Not a single thing. It was startling. One of those moments where you notice that something in your life has quietly gone off track.

Looking back, the pattern was obvious: I had let my routine slip. My days lacked structure, and without it, I couldn’t access the simple joys that usually grounded me. So, I made a plan to reclaim them.

Step one: treat my job search like a real job. I set daily and weekly goals, tracked metrics like resumes customized, applications submitted, and ATS scores achieved. 

Step two: enforce boundaries, so I wouldn’t let job searching take over my entire day. 

Step three: reward myself for progress.

And it worked. In the past week, I’ve rediscovered small pleasures: a few chapters of a gripping book, a cool morning gardening with the dogs happily playing, a movie that made me laugh out loud—and today, I’m looking forward to experimenting on a cherry-and-chocolate-chip cheesecake. (I always iterate on my proven recipes, and this one is promising.)

Sometimes the obvious escapes you when you’re in the middle of it. Getting perspective—taking stock of what matters—is one of the best ways to assess your mental health. After all, what are we if not all mental?

So thank you for asking about me, and thank you for reading. Here’s to finding structure, joy, and the occasional cheesecake—even in a job hunt.
